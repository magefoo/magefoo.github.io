### What is a profiler and why do I need to use one?

If we are going to understand why it is important to use a profiler, we need to begin with talking about performance. In today's ecommerce market performance is just as important, if not moreso than having any errors in your Magento store.  First, errors deteriorate the confidence of consumers in purchasing products from your store.  If a consumer notices an error, they will assume many things about your site, most likely disuading them from making a purchase at all.  When a potential
customer visits your site, they will be entering in the most private and protected information to make a purchase; their credit card number and all the details which coincide with it to allow for a successful purchase.  If they encounter an error, their confidence in the site becomes suspicious, and most will likely not take the chance to enter any confidential information at all, thus no sale.  I mean I certainly wouldn't. If a store owner cannot take the time, nor the effort, to
ensure their store is completely error free and functioning properly, then me as a consumer will lose all faith in doing any business with that store.  This does not just affect a single transacton, they lose me as a customer for life. Unfortunately, I am not the exception to the rule, but the normality. Not only do you lose that one transaction, you lose any future transactions as well.  This is why it is of the utmost importance to keep your store error free.
