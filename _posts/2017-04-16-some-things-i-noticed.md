*This list is not exhaustive, and I will be continually adding to it while I notice more things, so check back often!*

1.  Magento 2 Bundled products will take an exceptionally long time to load in both the frontend and especially Admin Product Edit if there are way too many Bundles and Products in the Single Bundled Product.  You will need a lot of memory on your local computer as well to load the Admin Bundled Product edit page or it will crash. So split up your bundled products if you decide to make them, a too large of one with many products under each option is gonna give you and your customers a headache.
